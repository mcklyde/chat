First thing you gotta do is actually make the project, then you can procrastinate and complain how we've done basically nothing. :)

We will most likely be using node.js


---Instructions to run index.js ---
1. Download node js here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
2. open a command line interface (cmd works) in the same directory as index.js is located
3. run the command 'node index.js'. If successful, should see "[date] server is listening on port 1234"
